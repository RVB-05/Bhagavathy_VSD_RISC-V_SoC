# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my journey through the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD**.
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress**, starting with environment setup and tool installation.

## Week 0 â€” Foundations of RISC-V SoC Design

| Task                          | Description                                                                                                            | Status |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| [**Task 0**](week_0/README.md) | Installed essential open-source EDA tools (**Iverilog**, **Yosys**, **GTKWave**, **Ngspice**) and configured Ubuntu VM | Completed|


### VM Configuration

* OS: Ubuntu 20.04+
* RAM: 6 GB
* HDD: 50 GB
* CPU: 4 vCPU

### Key Learnings from Week 0

* Installed and verified **essential EDA tools** successfully.
* Learned **basic environment setup** for RTL design and simulation.
* Prepared system for **upcoming RTL-to-GDSII experiments**.
