# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Embarking on the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD, this repository captures my hands-on experience with digital design workflows. Week 0 focuses on preparing the development environment, installing essential open-source EDA tools, and ensuring the system is ready for RTL design, simulation, and verification tasks.
